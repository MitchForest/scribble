# User Stories – Scribble MVP

## Personas
- **Student (primary):** 8-year-old practicing cursive on an iPad with Apple Pencil, short attention span, needs clear guidance and quick wins.
- **Facilitator (secondary):** Parent or teacher launching drills, checking progress, and encouraging practice streaks.

## Epic A – Launch & Navigation
1. *As a student, I want to open the app and immediately see the letters I should practice, so I know where to start without extra taps.*
2. *As a student, I want to view my mastery ring for each letter, so I can tell which ones need more work.*
3. *As a facilitator, I want to hand the iPad to a student and have it resume on the last letter they practiced, so we can continue seamlessly.*

## Epic B – Trace Mode Guidance
1. *As a student, I want to watch an animated example of the letter stroke-by-stroke, so I know the correct order and direction.*
2. *As a student, I want the app to highlight the correct start point and lock me in until I begin there, so I build proper habits.*
3. *As a student, I want a clear haptic alert when I start at the wrong point or drift off the path, so I can correct the stroke immediately.*

## Epic C – Ghost Mode Confidence
1. *As a student, I want a faint outline that fades as I trace, so I can test myself with less guidance.*
2. *As a student, I want to tap a hint button to replay the model stroke, so I can recover if I forget the motion.*
3. *As a student, I want to see stroke progress indicators, so I know how many steps remain.*

## Epic D – Memory Mode Mastery
1. *As a student, I want only the handwriting guides visible, so I can try writing the letter from memory.*
2. *As a student, I want immediate feedback if my strokes are out of order or direction, so I can adjust on the next attempt.*
3. *As a student, I want to replay my drawing alongside the model, so I can compare where I deviated.*

## Epic E – Validation & Feedback
1. *As a student, I want a score after each attempt, so I know how well I did.*
2. *As a student, I want short tips that explain what went wrong (e.g., wrong start point), so I have something concrete to fix.*
3. *As a facilitator, I want to see how many attempts a student made and their best score, so I can track improvement.*

## Epic F – Progression & Motivation
1. *As a student, I want my mastery ring to update after each attempt, so I can see my improvement.*
2. *As a student, I want the app to tell me when a new letter unlocks after I meet the goal, so practice feels rewarding.*
3. *As a facilitator, I want to know which letters are locked or unlocked, so I can plan drills quickly.*

## Epic G – Settings & Accessibility
1. *As a left-handed student, I want to enable left-handed mode, so controls and slant cues suit my grip.*
2. *As any student, I want to toggle haptics, so the experience fits my environment.*
3. *As a student using VoiceOver, I want feedback summaries to be readable, so I can understand my results without visual cues.*
