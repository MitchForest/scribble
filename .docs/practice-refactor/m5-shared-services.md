# Milestone 5 · Shared Utilities & Services Cleanup

_Last updated: 2024-04-01 by Codex agent._

## Progress Snapshot
- Introduced `Shared/Services/Haptics` with a `HapticsProviding` protocol and `SystemHapticsProvider` implementation. `PracticeRowViewModel` now accepts the dependency via its initializer (defaulting to the system provider) so row logic can be tested with stubs.
- Moved PencilKit surface bridging into `Shared/UI/PencilCanvasView.swift`, keeping the reusable canvas wrapper available to any feature without pulling from the practice module.
- Relocated `CheckpointValidator` under `Shared/Validation`, preserving the original algorithm while centralising cross-feature validation logic alongside `TraceCheckpointPlan`.
- Updated the practice tests to supply stubbed haptics providers and kept the simulator build green after the reshuffle.

## Next Actions
- Evaluate additional side-effectful services (e.g., `PracticeDataStore`) for protocol wrappers when we tackle dependency injection across modules.
- Follow up with a lightweight dependency registry so future features (home, onboarding) can opt into the shared services without new singletons.
